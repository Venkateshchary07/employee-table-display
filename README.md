Employee Table

This project displays a table of employees with their name, age, job title, and location.  
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The data is stored in the browser's localStorage  
and loaded dynamically into the table.

Files:
- table.html   : main HTML file
- table.css    : styles for the table
- table.js     : JavaScript for data storage and rendering

How to run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open table.html in your browser
3. The employee table will be displayed

Future improvements:
- Add a form to insert new employees
- Add sorting and filtering
- Connect to an API for real data
